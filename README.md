# A Simple CLI Coffee Logger

  It marks down the time and puts it an array, where it's stored in an external file. Then it's able to be read the time stamps inside the array, and output it in a message.
  There's a limiter to the amount of time stamps inside the array, and it's the number set by the limiter variable inside the coffee drink method. 
  Lists last coffee logged when ran with no option.
  For first runs, it's required to log one coffee of course, and by doing that it will create the file on the log path class variable.

### Changes to implement
1. Class variables
  * Have them be unset compared to what's on my own computer
