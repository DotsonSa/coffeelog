# A Simple Coffee Script Timer

## Not for timing coffee, but it's consumption

  Two methods right now for listing time since last coffee entry/drinking, with the other just being coffee drank/entered as the timestamp. 

### Changes to implement

1. change CLI stuff
  * Add agrument stuff for listing time and optional time listing within drank argument

2. longer history
  * Keep a certain amount of history within the time since drinking
